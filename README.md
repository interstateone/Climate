Climate
=======

A little Swift app to display the latest environment data from an [AirPi](http://airpi.es)

## Usage
Enter your Xively API key and feed ID in the AppDelegate where defaults are registered. The app will subscribe to the changes that get pushed down from Xively to your iOS device.

Note that I can't provide support for your AirPi or Xively account, but feedback and issues with this app are welcome.
